    <p>This city has seen it all: black dragon attacks, invading goliath hoardes, and a mild spike in the price of

    <p><em>Where some group of idiots made their first of many mistakes.</em></p>

    <p>If the Mooren river weren't so shallow this city would be a bustling port town. Instead it's a halfway point for

    <p><em>The city of water logged shoes.</em></p>
    <p>This is the largest port on the Eastern coast of Tal'Dorei. The city is surrounded by fetid swamps to the west,
        and the salty sea to the east.</p>
